# this is simply printing the string of "I will now count my chickens"
print("I will now count my chickens:")
# Python is interesting because it automatically prints the float instead of just an integer
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
# Here it does not print a float, I wonder why.
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
# again, just printing the string
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
# returns the result (float)
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
# here its just printing the string
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
# returns a boolean since we are asking "is it less than?"
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
# this prints string since its wrapped in quotes, then returns integer since we are doing math
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
# this does the same as above
print("what is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)
# printing string
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")
# again, printing string
print("How about some more.")
# now its returning a boolean value
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
# same as above
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
# again, just printing and returning boolean
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
